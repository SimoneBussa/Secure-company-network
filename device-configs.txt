# NETWORK AND DEVICE CONFIGURATION

1. Basic settings on all devices
    Hostname
    Banner motd
    No ip domain lookup
    Console, enable password
    Local username and password
    SSHv2 on routers and L3 switches

2. VLAN assignment
    Access switch ports in access mode for end-hosts
    Trunk links between access and distribution switches
    Unused ports shutdown in vlan 99
    Distribution ML-SWITCH with SVI for inter-VLAN routing
    ML-SWITCHx - CORE-Rx routed ports
    Routed uplinks between core-routers and multilayer switches

3. IP addressing
    Static assignments - Server room:
     172.16.3.129 for DG
     172.16.3.130 for DHCP-server
     172.16.3.131 for DNS-server
     172.16.3.132 for Servers-PC
     Static IP assignments on distribution and core switch routed ports

4. OSPF area 0: L3-switches, core routers, FW1 

5. DHCP configuration:
    Centralized DHCP server (172.16.3.130):
     Separate pools for each department
     120 addresses to lease per department
     First 5 addresses reserved for static assignments
     Gateway set as the first available IP in the network range

6. DNS server configuration
    Internal DNS-server (172.16.3.131) for hostname resolutions

7. Inter-VLAN routing on L3 switches using SVIs + dhcp helper service
    HSRP for redundancy and load balancing between ML-SWITCH1 and ML-SWITCH2
    HSRP with preemption
    ML-SWITCH1 = active router for vlan 10,20,30 (standby for other vlans)
    ML-SWITCH2 = active router for vlan 40,50,60 (standby for other vlans)
    Virtual IP = first IP in the network range
    Second available IP = vlan interface ML-SWITCH1
    Third available IP = vlan interface ML-SWITCH2
    ip helper address on each vlan interface

8. Wireless network access
    Autonomous AP using WPA2-PSK as authentication method

9. FW configuration
    Security level 100 for internal interfaces
    Security level 70 for DMZ
    Security level 0 for interfaces toward ISP
    Static default route to ISP1 (def AD=1)
    Floating static default route to ISP2 (AD=5)
    Default route redistribution using OSPF

10. NAT on firewall FW1
     Inside local: 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0
     Inside global: FW1 public IP (dynamic overload)

11. DMZ zone
     Servers configured with public IP addresses
     
12. Remote branch office
     Etherchannel between access-switch and CORE-SW3 for redundancy and load balancing
     CORE-SW3 with SVI for inter-vlan routing
     CORE-SW3 acting as local DHCP server 
      First 50 IP addresses reserved for static assignments
      First IP address for default gateway (VLAN interface on CORE-SW3)
      Pool for marketing and pool for Voip 
      Option 150 for VoIP
     FW2 acting performing NAT
      Inside local: 172.16.4.0 255.255.254.0
      Inside global: FW2 public IP (dynamic overload)  
     FW2 configured with a default static route toward ISP3
     OSPF area 1 for remote branch routing

13. Internet networks
     ISP with static routes to public company network
     OSPF area 10
     ISP redistribute static routes

14. IPsec Site-to-site VPN between central and remote site
     hash = sha
     authentication = PSK
     encryption = 3des
     tunnel endpoints = FW1 and FW2 public IPs
